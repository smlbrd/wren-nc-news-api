## 🦇 About <a name = "about"></a>

This RESTful API has been built to access application data programmatically using CRUD operations.

The intention is to mimic the construction of a real-world backend news service (such as Reddit), which should provide information to frontend architecture. 

It allows a client to post, get, patch and delete articles, topics, users and comments. It also accepts complex database queries using parametric endpoints, manipulating data to sort, order, limit and paginate the response.

It has been designed with the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern and developed using Test-Driven Development (TDD).

A hosted version of this project is [available online here](https://wren-nc-news.onrender.com/api).

The frontend component of this project [can be viewed here](https://github.com/smlbrd/wren-nc-news-frontend/blob/main/README.md)

## 🚀 Getting Started <a name = "getting-started"></a>

These instructions will get a copy of this project running on your local machine for development and testing purposes!

### ⛏️ Prerequisites <a name = "prerequisites"></a>

We need to create a clone of the repository, install some dependencies and set up our testing and development databases.

This API uses Node.js and PostgreSQL for database interactions, so please ensure your installation meets the following minimum requirements:

```bash
- Node v22.8.0
- PostgreSQL v16.4
```

### 🐏 Cloning this repository <a name = "cloning"></a>
